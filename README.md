1. Project Title & Abstract

Title: Design and Implementation of a Secure Company Network System

Abstract: Brief summary (5–6 lines) explaining the purpose of the project, the context (Algérie Télécom case study), and what was achieved (secure, scalable, redundant network design).

2. Objectives

Build a reliable and secure company network.

Ensure redundancy, high availability, and scalability.

Implement cybersecurity measures (firewalls, VLANs, ACLs, VPNs, IDS/IPS).

Integrate VoIP and secure remote access.

3. Methodology

Analysis: Study of Algérie Télécom’s current infrastructure (internal + external).

Design: Chose hierarchical topology, VLAN segmentation, DMZ, dual firewalls, HSRP redundancy.

Implementation: Used Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation, configured routers, switches, and ASA firewall.

Security: Applied ACLs, SSH, DHCP Snooping, OSPF authentication, NAT, and site-to-site IPsec VPN.

4. Technologies & Tools

Simulation: Cisco Packet Tracer

Protocols: VLAN, OSPF, HSRP, EtherChannel, STP, NAT, SSH, VPN (IPSec).

Devices: Cisco ASA Firewall, Layer 3 switches, Routers, VoIP devices.

Security: IDS/IPS, ACLs, Syslog, Port Security, WPA3.

5. Results

A modular and scalable architecture.

Secure inter-VLAN communication.

DMZ-protected servers.

High availability with HSRP & EtherChannel.

Site-to-Site VPN for remote secure access.

Integrated VoIP with VLAN 70.
